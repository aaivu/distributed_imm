# Distributed IMM
This repo has the development code for the distributed IMM algorithm. The final implementation can be found in d_imm_scala. 

**Scalable Iterative Mistake Minimization (IMM) for Clustering Explanations**

Distributed IMM is a scalable **PySpark** implementation of the IMM algorithm for clustering explanations. It includes **Cython-optimized histogram-based splitting** and **K-Means initialization** for efficiency.

## Features
- **Distributed IMM computation** for large datasets
- **Optimized histogram-based splitting**
- **Optimized mistake calculation with histograms**
- **K-Means initialization** for clustering
